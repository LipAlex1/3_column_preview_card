## Overview

I am currently working on improving my proficiency at HTML and CSS. Those are the only technologies used on this project.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

I am still at a stage where fundamental understanding of HTML and CSS needs to be established through practicing on building projects. At this point in time the focus is not necessarily on working efficiently but effectively and to produce code that lives up to industry standard.

I start the process from analyzing the figma file and the style guide. Once I have a profound idea what the webpage is going to look like which resources it comprises and how it interacts with the user, I start building it in atom IDE.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I made progress on estimating the complexity of projects and the time requirements respectively. In the process of building the page I had to research how to solve minor issues which gave me a deeper insight into how to work more efficiently and effectively on future projects. A highlight was getting to the solution of vertically centering text in the button which is an anchor tag by setting the line-height of the anchor-tag to its very own size:

index.html:
<div class="link">
  <a href="">Learn More</a>
</div>

index.css:
main a {
  ...
  height: 48px;
  ...
  line-height: 48px;
  ...
}

The effect of this declaration is that the link-text will be centered vertically.

Another takeaway certainly was that I had a lot of fun doing this project and it made me hungry for more.

### Continued development

I feel it's safe to say that I should start looking into CSS preprocessors as I see that there is a need to speed up the building process and to gain more experience doing more projects.
